# Castle.prx.org

## Description

[Phoenix app](http://www.phoenixframework.org) providing an API to PRX metrics in BigQuery.

This project follows the [standards for PRX services](https://github.com/PRX/meta.prx.org/wiki/Project-Standards#services).

## Installation

### Local

To get started, make sure you have completed the [Phoenix install guide](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation).  Then:

```
# Get the code
git clone git@github.com:PRX/castle.prx.org.git

# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Configure your environment (you'll need a bigquery table and service account)
cp env-example .env
vi .env
```

### Docker

Currently on OSX, [Dinghy](https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy) is probably
the best way to set up your dev environment.  Using VirtualBox is recommended.
Also be sure to install `docker-compose` along with the toolbox.

This project is setup primarily to build a `MIX_ENV=prod` docker image. To avoid
recompiling dependencies every time you run a non-prod docker-compose command,
mount some local directories to mask the build/deps directories in the image.

```
docker-compose build

# mount dev dependencies locally
mkdir _build_docker_compose deps_docker_compose
docker-compose run castle compile

# now you can run a local server
docker-compose up
open http://castle.prx.docker

# or run the tests
docker-compose run castle test
docker-compose run castle test --include external

# or run a single test
docker-compose run castle test test/controllers/api/root_controller_test.exs
```

## Dependencies

Currently, just BigQuery.

## Usage

```
# Start the phoenix server
mix phoenix.server

# Or run interactively
iex -S mix phoenix.server

# Or just get a console
iex -S mix
```

## Testing

```
# Run all the tests
mix test

# Run a specific test
mix test test/big_query/base/http_test.exs

# Include external dependency tests (requires a valid .env)
mix test --include external
```
